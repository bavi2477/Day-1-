# Day-3-Task

## This repository contains the three programs using object and XMLHttpRequest.

### There are three documents in this repository namely,

* Comparing.
* flag display.
* location.

## Comparing

* In this we get two objects as a input with same keys and values but with different order.
* The code is to tell whether two objects are same.

## flag display

* In this we have used a const url :link: => https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all to extract the `flags png link` and display the links in the console.

## location

* In this we have used the same above link and extracted the `country name`, `region`, `subregion` and `population` of the country.
* Displaying everything in a console.
